# Personal Passion Project

## For Who
For my personal project I wanted to created something for my personal environment. So I thought about making something for my godchild, who is no 2 years old and starting to speak more and more. She's also already quite proficient with an iPad as she can use it sometimes to watch Youtube Kids.

## Core Project Statement
An iOS where you'll be able to detect objects in real-time using the camera. The object detected will be shown and spoken out loud. In this way little kids can explore their surroundings and discover new words. 

The app shall include:
- Machine Learning    => Core ML
- Text-To-Speech      => integrated in Swift
- Translation SDK     => IBM Watson

## Deliverables
- iOS app
- Google Colab notebook
